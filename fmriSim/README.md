# fMRISim
## This part of the repository is about [fmriSim](https://github.com/brainiak/brainiak/blob/master/brainiak/utils/fmrisim.py), [Brainiak](https://github.com/brainiak/brainiak) and [Ellis' paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/532424v2) on fmriSim & Brainiak.

* [fmrisim_multivariate_replicate](https://github.com/caggursoy/phdSideQuests/blob/master/fmriSim/fmrisim_multivariate_replicate.ipynb) file is the replication of what Ellis has done both, which can be observed in their GitHub repo of Brainiak and related paper. 
* [fmrisim_multivariate_trial0](https://github.com/caggursoy/phdSideQuests/blob/master/fmriSim/fmrisim_multivariate_trial0.ipynb) file will be updated for our needs and using Ellis' work as basis.
