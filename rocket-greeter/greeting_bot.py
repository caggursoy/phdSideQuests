            Welcome to the CIMH Early Career Researcher RocketChat Workspace!*

            Happy to have you on board '''+ user_msgd + '''üëã!, Get started by introducing yourself in the ''' +intro_ch+ ''' channel. Tell us where you‚Äôre from, your area of expertise, and what you are up to. We are excited to meet you! By default, you are already a member of the following discussions/channels:

            '''+general_ch+''' - general announcements and information that everyone should know
            '''+random_ch+''' - water cooler talk and banter
            '''+int_ch+''' - if you are an international researcher, you might wanna join this channel üôÇ

            If you have questions about using RocketChat you can ask ''' +joh_ch+ ' or ' +sim_ch+ ''' for assistance üí™

            Our mailing list üì¨

            The CIMH Early Career Researchers also have their own mailing list where we share information on upcoming events. If you want to join, follow these steps:
            1) Log in to Outlook with the browser version of Outlook (it works only with the browser option, not with the installed version).
