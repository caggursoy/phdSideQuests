# phdSideQuests
## A repository for side quests (i.e. projects) I've encountered (i.e. I plan to meddle with) during my PhD.

### Chronicle

The first quest I have encountered is [animalNet](https://github.com/caggursoy/phdSideQuests/tree/master/animalNet) where I will try to downscale the ANN I have used in my MSc project into a more compact and less deep-layered one.
The plan is to make it distinguish between animals.
For now I only have following animals' images in dataset: [ "butterfly", "cat", "chicken", "cow", "dog", "elephant", "horse", "sheep", "spider", "squirrel"]
