# PuG24Cal

Works only for PuG24 :)
Reads the PuG24 program from the PDF and pushes the events into a GCal where you can subscribe and follow from your apps!

   - This will download a ZIP file containing an `.ics` file of your calendar.

### Step 2: Create a New Calendar

   - If you're not already there, go back to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com).

2. **Create a New Calendar**:
   - Click on the `+` icon next to `Other calendars` on the left sidebar.
